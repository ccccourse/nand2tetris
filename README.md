## Nand2Tetris

### Hardware

From project 1 to project 5, this courses teaches as how to build a CPU from a Nand chip

### Software

Using `ANSI C` without any dependencies to implement all the software part so as to practice
my skills in C
The software part includes `Assembler`, `VMTranslator`, `JackAnalyzer`, and `JackCompiler`.
The hash table I used in `JackCompiler` is learned from the C bible, `K&R`.

### Go further (Not necessarily in this project, might seperate to the new one)
- http://www.marksmath.com/tecs/
- Make use of Multithreading on Assembler
- Optimize the `Assembly code` generated by the `VMTranslator`
- Improve the `Jack Language`
    - Public attributes
    - Inheretance and polymorphism
    - More robust type system
    - No need of `Let` and `Do` to call the `subroutineCall`
    - Generate Assembly code on the fly instead of generating the VM code
